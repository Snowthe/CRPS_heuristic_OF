# CRPS_heuristic_OF
Using the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) as an heuristic objective 
function in hydrological model calibration

This repository contains scripts used to calculate grid-aggregated error 
metrics for residuals of groundwater head observations from wells. The error 
metrics are 
* MSE
* MAE
* MRE
* CRPS

It is originally used in context with the calibration of a MIKE SHE 
hydrological model with PEST or OSTRICH optimization tools.

"Storaa_GWhead_test_observations.txt" is a test input file, and 
"Storaa_GWhead_test_grids.txt" and "Storaa_GWhead_test_grids_crpsDis.txt" are 
the respective test output files.
